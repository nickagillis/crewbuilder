# CrewBuilder V2 - AI Agent System Builder

## 🚀 Overview
CrewBuilder V2 builds and deploys complete AI agent systems from natural language requirements. Using proper CrewAI patterns with **8 specialized agents**, we create production-ready systems and deploy them to managed infrastructure.

## ✨ What's New in V2
- **Proper CrewAI Patterns**: Simple agents, smart tasks, hierarchical orchestration
- **8 Focused Specialists**: Down from 11 over-engineered agents
- **Hosted Solution**: We deploy and manage your AI systems
- **Conversational UI**: Natural chat interface for requirements clarification
