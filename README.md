# CrewBuilder - AI Agent Meta-System

**Building AI agents that build AI agent systems.**

## Overview

CrewBuilder is a meta-crew system that automatically generates, deploys, and maintains custom CrewAI agent systems for businesses. Simply describe your automation needs in natural language, and CrewBuilder designs and creates a complete multi-agent crew to solve your specific business challenges.

## Current Status

ðŸš€ **Phase 2 Complete: System Architect** (2 of 10 agents built)

### âœ… Operational Pipeline
```
Business Requirements â†’ Requirements Analyst â†’ Technical Specification â†’ System Architect â†’ Crew Architecture
```

### âœ… Working Agents
- **Requirements Analyst** - Transforms business needs into structured technical specifications
- **System Architect** - Designs optimal multi-agent crew architectures from technical specs

### ðŸ”„ Current Development
- **Code Generator** - Convert crew architectures into production CrewAI Python code

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crewbuilder.git
cd crewbuilder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Complete Demonstration
```bash
python demo.py
```

This runs:
- **Dogfooding Test**: CrewBuilder analyzing itself (meta-system validation)
- **Customer Example**: Digital marketing agency automation
- **Complexity Demonstration**: Various business scenarios

### Run Individual Components
```bash
# Main application
python main.py

# Test individual agents
python agents/requirements_analyst.py
python agents/system_architect.py
```

## Architecture

### Core Philosophy: Dogfooding
CrewBuilder uses itself to improve itself. Every agent is built and tested by having CrewBuilder generate crews for its own development needs. This ensures real-world validation and continuous improvement.

### Current Pipeline (2/10 Agents)
1. **Requirements Analyst** âœ… - Natural language â†’ Technical requirements
2. **System Architect** âœ… - Technical requirements â†’ Agent architecture  
3. **Code Generator** ðŸ”„ - Agent architecture â†’ CrewAI Python code
4. **API Detective** ðŸ“‹ - Integration analysis and recommendations
5. **Documentation Specialist** ðŸ“‹ - User guides and setup instructions
6. **Quality Assurance** ðŸ“‹ - Code validation and testing
7. **Infrastructure Analyst** ðŸ“‹ - Hosting platform recommendations
8. **Deployment Engineer** ðŸ“‹ - Automated deployment scripts
9. **Hosting Assistant** ðŸ“‹ - Step-by-step deployment guides
10. **Monitoring Engineer** ðŸ“‹ - Performance tracking and maintenance

### Business Model
- **Basic ($299)**: Code generation + basic deployment
- **Professional ($999)**: Full deployment + monitoring + optimization  
- **Enterprise ($2,999)**: Complete infrastructure + ongoing support + SLA

## Example Usage

### Input: Business Requirements
```
