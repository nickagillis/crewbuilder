# CrewBuilder + AI Development Standards v4.0 Integration Plan

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT
Nick has sophisticated AI Development Standards v4.0 framework that requires:
- Mandatory session logging FIRST (npm run log-collaboration)
- Zero-tolerance violation prevention 
- User quality assurance empowerment
- Evidence required for all claims
- No shortcuts even during emergencies

## ðŸ”„ INTEGRATION STRATEGY
1. **Session Protocol**: Adapt his session logging to work with Serena
2. **Quality Assurance**: Empower Nick to verify all claims with evidence
3. **Standards Compliance**: CrewBuilder must follow his development patterns
4. **Evidence-Based**: All completion claims require testing proof
5. **User Oversight**: Nick can stop work if violations detected

## ðŸŽ¯ CREWBUILDER DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
- Follow his ai-development-standards repository patterns
- Use his template structure for consistency
- Integrate with his compliance validation framework
- Provide evidence for all functionality claims
- Welcome user quality assurance throughout

- nickagillis/ai-development-standards (main framework)
- nickagillis/ai-development-templates (template patterns)
- nickagillis/ai-development-standards-mcp-server (MCP integration)
