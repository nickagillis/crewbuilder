- [x] `runtime.txt` - Python version
- [x] `.gitignore` - Properly ignores .env

### Ready for Deployment:
- [x] Backend server tested locally
- [x] Frontend builds successfully  
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Railway deployment module complete
- [x] API endpoints documented
- [x] Error handling in place

## Deployment Steps:

### 1. Commit Current Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment integration and update documentation"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `crewbuilder`
3. Description: "AI-powered system that generates and deploys AI agent teams"
4. Make it public or private (your choice)
5. Don't initialize with README (we have one)

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crewbuilder.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Deploy to Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app/new
2. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `crewbuilder` repository
4. Railway will auto-detect the configuration
5. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (your key)
   - `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (your token)

### 5. Post-Deployment
1. Get your Railway URL (e.g., https://crewbuilder.up.railway.app)
2. Update CORS in `api_server.py` to include Railway URL
3. Redeploy with the update

## Important Notes:

### What Gets Deployed:
- FastAPI backend running the 10 agents
- Static file serving for frontend (or separate deployment)
- Railway will handle SSL, scaling, monitoring

### What to Watch:
- First deployment may take 5-10 minutes
- Check build logs for any errors
- Monitor resource usage in Railway dashboard
- Test the live URL thoroughly

### Frontend Options:
1. **Option A**: Deploy frontend to Vercel (recommended)
   - Better performance for static files
   - Free tier is generous
   - Update API URL in frontend to point to Railway backend

2. **Option B**: Serve frontend from FastAPI
   - Single deployment
   - Need to add static file serving to api_server.py

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] Live URL accessible
- [ ] Can generate AI systems
- [ ] Can deploy to Railway (with token)
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs
- [ ] Resource usage within free tier
