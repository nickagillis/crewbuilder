# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context File

## Project Overview
CrewBuilder is an AI-powered meta-system that generates complete, production-ready CrewAI agent systems from natural language business requirements. The project is ~90% complete with successful deployments to Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

### Two Distinct Systems
1. **CrewBuilder Platform** - Our hosted service (this codebase)
   - 11 specialized AI agents that build other agent systems
   - Hosted on Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
   - Auto-deploys from GitHub
   
2. **Client Systems** - What CrewBuilder generates
   - Independent CrewAI agent systems for each client
   - Deployed to shared Railway infrastructure
   - Each client gets their own dashboard and API keys
   - Completely isolated from CrewBuilder and other clients

## Live URLs
- Backend API: https://web-production-bd955.up.railway.app
- Frontend App: https://crewbuilder.vercel.app

## Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-07-16)
- **Core Functionality**: üîÑ Adding Clarification Agent (10/11 agents complete)
- **Deployment**: ‚úÖ Live on Railway and Vercel
- **Client Deployment**: üîÑ Implementing managed deployment model
- **Testing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs real-world validation
- **Business Model**: üîÑ In development

## MVP Architecture

### Client Journey
1. **Clarification** - Chat with AI to refine requirements
2. **Generation** - 11-agent pipeline creates their system
3. **Deployment** - Automatic deployment to managed infrastructure
4. **Access** - Client receives dashboard URL + setup key
5. **Configuration** - Client adds their API keys via dashboard
6. **Production** - System runs independently

### Deployment Model
- **Managed Infrastructure**: CrewBuilder owns Railway account
- **Service Isolation**: Each client gets dedicated Railway service
- **Client Dashboard**: Simple web UI for each deployment
  - `/setup` - Initial API key configuration
  - `/status` - System health monitoring
  - `/test` - Agent testing interface
  - `/api-keys` - Secure key management

## Key Commands & Scripts
```bash
# Frontend (Next.js)
cd frontend
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # TypeScript checking

# Backend (FastAPI)
cd backend
python -m venv venv  # Create virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate # Activate (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py       # Start server

# Testing
pytest              # Run backend tests
npm test           # Run frontend tests (if configured)
```

## Active Development Areas
1. **Clarification Agent** - Interactive requirements refinement before generation
2. **Client Dashboard Generation** - Auto-generate dashboard with each system
3. **Railway Service Deployment** - Deploy as services, not separate projects
2. **API Key Management UI** - Implemented but untested
3. **Error Handling** - Needs improvement for edge cases
4. **Cost Optimization** - API usage needs analysis

## Known Issues & TODOs
- [ ] Test full deployment flow with actual Railway tokens
- [x] Railway deployment implementation is complete
- [ ] Add Clarification Agent for requirements refinement
- [ ] Implement client dashboard generation
- [ ] Switch to service-based deployment model
- [ ] Validate deployed systems work in production
- [ ] Calculate real API costs per system generation
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries in frontend
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging (partially done)
- [ ] User authentication and session management

### Deployment Implementation Status
The deployment process has 3 steps:
1. **Generate system code** - Working ‚úÖ
2. **Deploy to Railway** - Implemented ‚úÖ
3. **Set environment variables** - Implemented ‚úÖ

**Recent Updates:**
- Implemented full Railway API integration in `railway_deployer.py`
- Added Railway GitHub integration support in `railway_github_deployer.py`
- System now attempts GitHub integration first, falls back to direct deployment
- Added comprehensive logging throughout deployment process

**Deployment Methods:**
1. **GitHub Integration** (preferred) - Uses Railway's GitHub integration
   - Requires: `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `CREWBUILDER_GITHUB_REPO` env vars
   - Creates branches and pushes code via GitHub API
   
2. **Direct Deployment** (fallback) - Creates tarball and uploads directly
   - Works with just `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
   - Uses Railway GraphQL API

## Recent Changes
- Added Railway deployment module with one-click deployment (partially implemented)
- Implemented API key management in frontend
- Fixed TypeScript error handling for unknown error types
- Updated CORS configuration for live Vercel URL
- Added detailed logging for deployment steps to help debug failures
- Fixed issue where generated code wasn't being passed to deployment
- Implemented complete Railway deployment with API integration
- Added Railway GitHub integration as preferred deployment method

## AI Agent Capabilities
The system includes 11 specialized agents:
1. **Requirements Analyst** - Parses business requirements
2. **System Architect** - Designs system architecture
3. **Code Generator** - Generates CrewAI agent code
4. **Quality Assurance** - Tests and validates systems
5. **API Detective** - Discovers and integrates APIs
6. **Documentation Specialist** - Creates comprehensive docs
7. **Infrastructure Analyst** - Optimizes infrastructure
8. **Deployment Engineer** - Handles deployment configs
9. **Hosting Assistant** - Manages hosting setup
10. **Monitoring Engineer** - Sets up monitoring/logging
11. **Clarification Agent** - Interactive requirements refinement (NEW)

## Development Best Practices
1. Always run lint and type-check before committing
2. Test API endpoints with the live backend URL
3. Use environment variables for sensitive data
4. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
5. Update PROGRESS.md when completing major features

## Environment Variables
```
# Backend
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_token

# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://web-production-bd955.up.railway.app
```

## Quick Troubleshooting
- **CORS errors**: Check backend CORS configuration includes frontend URL
- **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run type-check` to identify issues
- **API connection**: Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is set correctly
- **Railway deployment**: Ensure RAILWAY_TOKEN is valid and has proper permissions

## Next Session Priorities
Based on CONSOLIDATED_STRATEGY.md:
1. Test Railway deployment with real tokens
2. Validate end-to-end system generation and deployment
3. Calculate and document API usage costs
4. Begin user testing with 3-5 beta users
